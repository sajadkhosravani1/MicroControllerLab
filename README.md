# Micro controller lab
In this repository I'm going to share My micro controller lab experiments with you.

## requirements
I have used:
- **ATmega32**: A famous micro controller from ATMEL company
- **CodeVisionAVR**: A famous tool for programming micro controllers.
- **Proteus 8**: A famous and power full software for simulating circuits. We use it in order to simulate our environment components such as micro controller.

## experiments:
- [experiment 1](ex1/):
Simple IO
- [experiment 2](ex2/): 
Design and simulate a circuit so that show words and sentences on a 16x2 lcd `animatedly`.
