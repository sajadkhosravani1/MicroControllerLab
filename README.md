# Micro controller lab
In this repository I'm going to share My micro controller lab experiments with you.

## requirements
I have used:
- **ATmega32**: A famous micro controller from ATMEL company
- **CodeVisionAVR**: A famous tool for programming micro controllers.
- **Proteus 8**: A famous and power full software for simulating circuits. We use it in order to simulate our environment components such as micro controller.
